# Web based career tracking application.

SEEKR is an all in one tool to help job seekers land their dream job. While it is currently still in the works, here are some of the featuers it includes. Once users are on-boarded into the system, users can then create job cards which are saved to the job board. Users can edit them and attach contacts to each of them as well. It also includes a contact book which users can save all of their networking information to as well as saving any actions they've taken with each contact or job card. This application is built and designed by Alex Miller starting in October 2020 and should be ready for release in February 2021.

Some future updates and features that can be expected in this next year will be data metrics and charting of progress, an integrated Google Chrome extension for users to save jobs directly to their board from their favorite job seaching sites and an internal job board compiled from related companies based on user's interests.
